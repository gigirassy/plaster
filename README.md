## Plaster is an alternative frontend to Pastebin I came up with at 11:30 PM.
Fetches raw data and displays it. Took like 20 minutes to make the first build.

It's extremely simple, so it's under CC0. If you want to improve it, simply submit a pull request. By submitting one, you agree to release your code under the public domain.

### Disclaimer
The first build was made using a language learning model, and then significantly tweaked by a human being (me). This might be outside of people's comfort zones, so I'd thought it'd be important to note this. This is part of the reason why the code is public-domain.
## To do:
* Implement (togglable!) fetching of paste views, creator usernames, favorites, and expiration/creation dates.
* Togglable, just-for-fun ASCII art of TFA characters on front page bottom-right corner. Owners can also change this ASCII art by mounting TXT files as a volume.
